Task 1b

• What is the largest block size supported on your system?
After running the code with several different block sizes, the largest block size we were able to send in 
before the values turned negative was 5519 bytes.


• What is the highest bandwidth you can achieve and at which block size is this bandwidth achieved?
The highest bandwidth we achieved was approximately between block sizes 4000 - 5000. 


• Does the bandwidth change when you start several instances of your program at the same time?
Yes. When only running the process in one terminal we see the bandwidth is a certain size, when we start running another process 
the bandwidth in the first process significantly decreases. When we terimante one of the two processes, the bandwidth of the 
currently running process increases again. 

Task 1d
• What is the largest block size supported on your system?
The largest block size supported in our system is 20 GB, which in our humble opinion is quite a lot of bytes. 

• What is the highest bandwidth you can achieve and at which block size is this bandwidth achieved?
The highest bandwidth we acheived was 1.3 GB/sec, the block we passed through the pipe was 20 kB big. 


• Does the bandwidth change when you start several instances of your program at the same time?
Yes, but the changes are less drastic than they were for the unnamed pipes :)))
